# Advent of Code 2021
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) entries for 2021. Warning: rough code!

Written in pure Ruby for execution via the command line. The point of which is to get the job done rather than show off coding skills but it might get tidied up later.

These examples usually have both parts of each day's challenge in one file.

Abandoned on day 15 (or 12, if you count the first one I failed to do).
